# DSA JavaScript  Assignment - Basics

**Total Questions: 5**  
**Level: 4 SOD**  
**Topics: Variables, Operators, Conditionals, Loops, Arrays & Objects**

## Question 1: Calculate Shopping Total (Variables & Operators)

Create variables to store the prices of 4 items you bought at a store:
- `item1` = 15.50
- `item2` = 23.00
- `item3` = 8.75
- `item4` = 12.25

Calculate and display:
1. The total price of all items
2. The average price per item
3. If you pay with 100, how much change will you get?

**Expected Output:**
```javascript
Total: 59.5
Average: 14.875
Change: 40.5
```

## Question 2: Age Classifier (Conditionals)

Create a variable called `age` and assign it a value.

Write conditional statements to print the age category:
- 0-12: "Child"
- 13-17: "Teenager"
- 18-59: "Adult"
- 60 and above: "Senior"

Test your code with different age values: 10, 16, 25, 65

**Example Output:**
```javascript
// For age = 16
You are a Teenager
```

## Question 3: Multiplication Table (Loops)

Use a `for` loop to print the multiplication table for the number 7, from 1 to 10.

**Expected Output:**
```
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70
```

**Bonus Challenge:** Modify your code to skip printing the line when the result is 35 (use `continue`)

## Question 4: Array Operations (Arrays & Loops)

Create an array called `temperatures` with the following values:
```javascript
let temperatures = [23, 28, 19, 31, 25, 22, 30];
```

Write code to:
1. Print all temperatures using a loop
2. Find and print the highest temperature (use a loop and comparison)
3. Find and print the lowest temperature (use a loop and comparison)
4. Count how many days had temperature above 25

**Expected Output:**
```
Temperatures: 23, 28, 19, 31, 25, 22, 30
Highest temperature: 31
Lowest temperature: 19
Days above 25: 3
```

## Question 5: Student Information (Objects & Conditionals)

Create an object called `student` with the following properties:
```javascript
let student = {
    name: "John",
    rollNumber: 101,
    marks: 78,
    subject: "Mathematics"
};
```

Write code to:
1. Print all student information using `console.log`
2. Determine and print the grade based on marks:
   - 90-100: "Excellent"
   - 75-89: "Very Good"
   - 60-74: "Good"
   - 50-59: "Average"
   - Below 50: "Needs Improvement"
3. Check if the student passed (marks >= 50) and print "Pass" or "Fail"

**Expected Output:**
```
Name: John
Roll Number: 101
Marks: 78
Subject: Mathematics
Grade: Very Good
Result: Pass
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a file named `basics_assignment.js`
2. Write clear comments before each question
3. Test your code to ensure it runs without errors
4. Use meaningful variable names

## Tips for Success

- Remember to use `let` or `const` for variables
- Use proper indentation for readability
- Test with different values to ensure your code works correctly
- Add comments explaining what each section does
